## Battleground Commander
Provides quality of life features for Battlegrounds.

### Enhanced Group Queue tools
This adds extra ready check tools, as well as being able to see who has a deserter debuff, or mercenary contract. As
the mercenary contract is invisible to other players, the players you want to see the contract for need to have this
addon installed.
