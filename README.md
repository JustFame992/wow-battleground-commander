## Battleground Commander
Provides quality of life features for Battlegrounds. 

### Queue Tools
This adds extra ready check tools, as well as being able to see who has a deserter debuff, or mercenary contract. As
the mercenary contract is invisible to other players, the players you want to see the contract for need to have this
addon installed.

### Battleground Tools
Extra conveniences for Battlegrounds.

#### Instructions Frame
This frame shows Raid Warnings from your raid leader with a time to indicate how long ago this message was sent. You can
configure this frame to load only in specific zones, and it will filter out duplicate messages.
